# Hello World

My plan for attempting to begin a path of writing; ideas for keeping me from feeling blocked when authoring, tools I'm using to execute on these ideas and keep friction low, and of course the first step after the setup... this post you're reading right now!

So... this is a change.

I have had some interest in starting to write blog posts and content about my experience as a developer and sharing some of the things I have learned in my career. The biggest hurdle I have faced is finding the right platform and tools for me to write without feeling blocked or having barriers.

One avenue I am exploring for this is using Obsidian to author my content in plain markdown files, using a community plugin to automatically sync this content with a public GitHub repository, and using this repo as a database to fetch and display the content from wherever I want.

You might be thinking, as I sure was as I was theorizing this plan, that this doesn't sound simple at all. üëÄ Honestly... you would be right. I can joke and say that this is just the *way of the developer‚Ñ¢Ô∏è*, but in reality this is what I really felt was required for me to actually start writing. If it's as simple as opening an app on my Mac, creating a new file, and writing, what excuses do I have left?

As I am most familiar with Nuxt and its ecosystem of modules, the official Nuxt Content module seemed like a great fit. With a small amount of configuration I was able to wire up to my public repo, query for content that fit in expected parameters, and quickly style the content however I liked.
