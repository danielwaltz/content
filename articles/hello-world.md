# Hello World

My plan for attempting to begin a path of writing. Ideas for keeping me from feeling blocked when authoring, tools I'm using to execute on these ideas and keep friction low, and of course the first step after the setup... this post you are reading right now!

This is a change.

I have had some interest in starting to write blog posts and content about my experience as a developer and sharing some of the things I have learned in my career.

The biggest hurdle I have faced is finding the right platform and tools for me to write without feeling blocked or having barriers. One avenue I am exploring for this is using Obsidian to author my content in plain markdown files, automatically syncing this content with a public GitHub repository, and using this repo to fetch and display the content wherever I want!

As I am most familiar with Nuxt and its ecosystem of modules, the official Nuxt Content module seemed like a great fit. With a small amount of configuration I was able to wire up to my public repo, query for content that fit in expected parameters, and quickly style the content however I liked.
